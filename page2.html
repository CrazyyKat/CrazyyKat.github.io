<center> <p id="text"> I really enjoyed going to Rome.
  One of the highlights of this trip was getting to see the Colossuem.
  It was so monumental and intricate;
  I can't belive the Romans built it without modern construction technology.
  I also really enjoyed eating all the different kinds of gelato and pasta in Rome.
  I remember that one of the resturants we went to could only either run the air or the power,
  so we ended up turning on our phone flashlights and using water bottles as lanterns.
  It was really hot, but the cobbleston and the buildings were so beautiful.
  I really loved the faded aspects of the scenery and how everything seemed so quaint. </p> </center>
